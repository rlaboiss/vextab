This repository is related to an behavioral experiment on the perception of object stability under various situations that perturbs the perception of the gravity direction. You will find here the raw data and the code for processing the raw data and for doing the statistical analysis (in R).

The study related to this data/code is currently under submission to a peer reviewed journal. The instruction for running the code is still absent, but will be added in the near future. More coming soon.
